## About Me
I have been working in IT as a *Testing Engineer* since 2016 and I like it a lot. Now I am on Maternity leave and I want to devote part of my time to education. Becoming a programmer is my old dream. So I want to make it real! 

## Skills 
My skills mostly include functional and automation testing. But now I am learning and trying to focus and expand my knowledge in:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git
* Jest 

## Code example 
```
const deepCount = (a) => {
  return a.reduce((acc, cur) => {
    return acc + (Array.isArray(cur) ? deepCount(cur) : 0);
  }, a.length);
};
```

## Work Experience
 1. **Jun, 2016 - Till Now** 
     * EPAM Systems, _Senior Software Testing Engineer_
 2. **Jan, 2011 - Dec, 2015** 
     * I was working as an _accountant_ in several different  companies. 
  
## Languages
* English - **B2** (According to EPAM English testing)
* Russian - **native**
* Bulgarian - **Intermediate** (live and study there)

I worked on ***two foreign projects in EPAM***, where I need to use _English_. 
On the ***first project*** I worked only for a few months. The team was from the **Czech Republic**, so we had to interact in English.
The ***second project*** was more interesting. I worked on it for almost a year and a half. Part of the customer's team was based in **London, UK**. So English communication was on a daily basis, including daily stand-ups, communication with PM, analyst, developer and other people. During this period I was lucky to visit **London**, to live and work there for a couple of weeks during the _business trip_.
